#### About Myself:

I have 8 years of experience working for Hilti as a technical consultant. I was responsible for sales and development of the Gomel region. The essence of the work was in direct sales. My goal was to collect as much information from construction sites as possible, find the company's weaknesses, prepare an economic justification for the benefits of cooperation, and then successfully negotiate with the company's top management.
In June 2022, I decided to try myself as a frontend developer, because I see great prospects for growth in this.
